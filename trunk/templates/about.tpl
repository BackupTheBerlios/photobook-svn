<p class="heading">About this Site</p>
<p class="indent"><SITE_TITLE> is a place where I can practice my hobby and feel motivated to do more photography. I was using a Kodak DX3600 which had a very bad battery life and no features. Recently I picked up a cheap Canon Powershot A400 which has more features and lasts longer.</p>
